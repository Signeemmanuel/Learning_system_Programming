To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:

To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:

have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.

It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.

taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.

relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:

form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.

Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.

so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be

usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with

There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with

will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only

numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1

at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We

modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.

is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.

privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.

privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.

system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.

practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best

marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index

When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.

open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent

unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent

interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how

same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t

other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:

simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:

details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for

configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.

ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:
To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:


To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group

❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
❑ S_IXGRP: Execute permission, group
❑ S_IROTH: Read permission, others
❑ S_IWOTH: Write permission, others
❑ S_IXOTH: Execute permission, others


Random Access -lseek
Each read, write takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one, which means that
it access the file sequentially and contiguous. Using lseek, we can get any position in a file
relative to the original position.

This function means that set current position whose file descriptor is fd to the offset, which is
taken relative to the location specified by origin.


ioctl
It provides an interface for controlling the behavior of devices and their descriptors and
configuring underlying services. Terminals, file descriptors, sockets, and even tape drives may
have ioctl calls defined for them and you need to refer to the specific device’s man page for
details. POSIX defines only ioctl for streams, which are beyond the scope. Here’s the syntax:



To create a new file descriptor, you need to use the open system call.In 
simple terms, open establishes an access path to a file or device.If 
successful, it returns a file descriptor that can be used in read, write, and 
other system calls. The file descriptor is unique and isn’t shared by any
other processes that may be running. If two programs have a file open at the 
same time, they maintain distinct file descriptors. If they both write to the 
file, they will continue to write where they left off. Their data isn’t 
interleaved, but one will overwrite the other. Each keeps its own idea of how 
far into the file (the offset) it has read or written. You can prevent
unwanted clashes of this sort by using file locking, which you’ll see 
later on.
open open is rather like the fopen, except that instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file
descriptor, which is just an int.
When you open a file, with each file descriptor is associated a marker, which is a numeric index
that tells where your next read/write is going to take place. By default, when you open a file, the
marker starts at the first byte. So if your read/write five bytes for example then the marker moves
five bytes accordingly. Generally if you’re reading and writing to the same file, then is best
practice to have different file descriptors associated for the different tasks. So, you can use one to
read and the other to write so they don’t interfere with each other. Equally, you can use the
system call lseek to move the marker to a desired position.
NOTE!!! For chmod to work on a file, the process should be running in super user / root
privilege or must run the privilege of the owner who created that file.
The name of the file or device to be opened is passed as a parameter, path; the oflags parameter
is used to specify actions to be taken on opening the file.
The oflags are specified as a combination of a mandatory file access mode and other optional
modes. The open call must specify one of the file access modes shown in the following table:


open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or –1 if it fails,
at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for the failure. We
look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is always the lowest-
numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in some circumstances. For
example, if a program closes its standard output and then calls open again, the file descriptor 1
will be reused and the standard output will have been effectively redirected to a different file or
device.
There is also a creat call standardized by POSIX, but it is not often used. creat doesn’t only
create the file, as one might expect, but also opens it. It is the equivalent of calling open with
oflags equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

The number of files that any one running program may have open at once is limited. The limit,
usually defined by the constant OPEN_MAX in limits.h, varies from system to system, but
POSIX requires that it be at least 16. This limit may itself be subject to local system-wide limits
so that a program may not always be able to open this many files. On Linux, the limit may be
changed at runtime so OPEN_MAX is not a constant. It typically starts out at 256.


Initial Permissions
When you create a file using the O_CREAT flag with open, you must use the three-parameter
form. mode, the third parameter, is made from a bitwise OR of the flags defined in the header
file sys/stat.h. These are:
❑ S_IRUSR: Read permission, owner
❑ S_IWUSR: Write permission, owner
❑ S_IXUSR: Execute permission, owner
❑ S_IRGRP: Read permission, group
❑ S_IWGRP: Write permission, group
